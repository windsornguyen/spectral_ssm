# Spectral State Space Models ðŸ”¢ðŸ”„ðŸ”¢

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation for training and evaluating Spectral State Space Models (SSMs), as described in the paper [Spectral State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06837).

The paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range
dependencies and proposes a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based
on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm from Hazan et al. (2017). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction
architecture: the spectral state space model.

Spectral SSMs offer two primary advantages:
1. **Provable robustness**: Their performance is independent of the spectrum of the underlying dynamics and the dimensionality of the problem.
2. **Efficient learning**: These models use fixed convolutional filters that don't require learning, yet outperform traditional SSMs in both theory and practice.

## Key Features

- PyTorch implementation of the Spectral State Space Model
- Full (distributed) training pipeline for training and evaluation
- Includes implementations of various other architectures to run benchmarks against (Transformer, Mamba, Samba, etc.)
- Support for training on CPUs, GPUs, and Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend

## Installation

We recommend using the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package installer and resolver from Charlie Marsh '15 and the rest of the Astral team.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `spectral_ssm` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/windsornguyen/spectral_ssm.git
cd spectral_ssm
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ssm_env
source ssm_env/bin/activate
```

3. If you plan to use Apple's MPS backend, install PyTorch Nightly first:

```bash
uv pip install --pre torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

4. Install the required packages:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, for an editable installation:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The main training pipeline is contained in `example.py`. To run it:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 example.py
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the `docs/` directory. (TODO: To be made + document distributed training procedure)

## Model Architecture

The core of our implementation is the Spectral Temporal Unit (STU) block, which can be found in `model.py`. This file also contains the complete model architecture.
